**How do you prevent accidental resource deletion?**
To protect against accidental deleteion of critical resources, Terraform provides the `prevent_destroy` lifecycle argument. When this setting is enabled, any attempt to run `terraform destroy` or `apply` a configuration that removes or replaces the resource will fail. For example,
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "prod_data_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-production-data-bucket"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```
In this example, if you run `terraform destroy` or removes the S3 bucket definition from the Terraform code. Terraform will refuse to delete the bucket and show an error message such as *Resource `aws_s3_bucket.prod_data_bucket` has `lifecycle.prevent_destroy` set, but the plan calls for this resource to be destroyed.*

**How do you handle provider API rate limiting?**
- **Implement exponential backoff:** Many providers (like AWS) include built-in retry mechanisms for throttled API calls. But you can also configure or tune these settings in the provider block using `max_retries` attribute for AWS.
- **Use `time_sleep` resource between operations:** This resource in Terraform can introduce deliberate pauses between resource creations or modifications. This is useful for preventing bursts of API requests that could exceed rate limits.
- **Split large deployments into smaller batches:** You can split resources into smaller and more manageable batches that helps minimize the number of concurrent API calls. You can achieve this by using `Terraform modules`, `workspaces` or the `-target` option to apply only a subset of resources at a time.

---

**How do you recover from courrupted state file?**
- **Recover from backup:** The quickest way to recover from courrupted state file is from backup, if backup is configured. You can restore the state by replacing the corrupted state file with the backup file. This is why it is always recommended to use remote state storage with versioning (such as S3 with versioning enabled) or Terraform Cloud/Enterprise.
- **`terraform import`:** If the backup is unavailable or incomplete, you can use `terraform import` to reconstruct the state for existing resources. This command allows Terraform to associate existing infrastructure with resource definitions in your configuration, effectively rebuilding the state. For example: `terraform import aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket my-bucket-name`

---

**How do you migrate state from one backend to another?**
Migration steps:
- Run `terraform state pull` to save the current state locally as a backup.
- Update your Terraform configuration to define the new backend (for example, S3, Terraform Cloud, or other supported backends).
- Run `terraform init -migrate-state` to initialize Terraform with the new backend and migrate the existing state automatically.
- Verify that the state has been successfully migrated by checking the new backend for the state file.
**Note**: Always perform backend migration during maintenance windows and ensure you have proper backups to avoid accidental data loss or service disruption.

---

**How do you handle state drift in production environments?**
State drift occurs when the real-world infrastructure differs from the Terraform state that can lead to inconsistencies and deployment issues. To handle drift in production, regularly run `terraform plan` in CI/CD pipelines to detect any differences between the actual infrastructure and the Terraform state.
If drift is detected, you can use `terraform import` to reconcile resources that exist in the environment but are missing from the state. This brings Terraform back in sync without recreating resources. 
Additionally, it iss a best practice to set up automated drift detection with monitoring and alerts so that your team is immediately notified of any manual or unexpected modifications in production infrastructure.

---

**How do you manage secrets securely in Terraform?**
- store secrets in external systems: Use tools such as  HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault to store sensitive values instead of hardcoding them in Terraform code.
- Mark variables as sensitive: Use the `sensitive = true` attribute in variable definitions to prevent values from being displayed in logs, plan output.
    ```
    variable "db_password" {
    type      = string
    sensitive = true
    }
    ```
- Encrypt remote state: Ensure that your remote state backend such as S3 or Terraform Cloud is encrypted at rest so that sensitive information stored in the state file is protected.

---

**How do you properly structure Terraform modules for enterprise use?**
- **Create reusable modules:** Each module should encapsulate a specific piece of infrastructure such as a VPC, S3 bucket or RDS instance. The module should be designed to work independently of other modules. Expose only the necessary input variables and output values, keeping the internals hidden for simplicity and reusability. Also, use semantic versioning for modules so different teams can pin specific versions safely.
- **Define clear interfaces:** Module should use descriptive input variables with default values where appropriate. ALso, it should expose key attributes required by other modules or stacks as outputs.
- **Dependency Management:** Modules should consume outputs from other modules or use remote state data sources to obtain information about existing resources. 
Example module structure:
    ```
    terraform-repo/
    ├── modules/
    │   ├── vpc/
    │   │   ├── main.tf
    │   │   ├── variables.tf
    │   │   ├── outputs.tf
    │   │   └── README.md
    │   ├── s3_bucket/
    │   │   ├── main.tf
    │   │   ├── variables.tf
    │   │   ├── outputs.tf
    │   │   └── README.md
    └── README.md
    ```

---

**What happens if you change the `terraform.backend` configuration after a state file is already created?**
If you change the `terraform.backend` configuration after a state file is already created, Terraform will treat it as a change in the backend configuration. This can result in Terraform trying to migrate the state file from the old backend to the new one.

---

**What is the difference between `for_each` and `for` in Terraform?**
- **`for_each`:** It is used at the resource or module level to create multiple instances of a resource or module based on a map or set of strings. Each instance is identified by a unique key that makes it easier to manage, reference, and update individual resources. For example, if you want to create three S3 buckets dynamically, you can use `for_each`:
    ```
    variable "buckets" {
    type    = set(string)
    default = ["dev-bucket", "staging-bucket", "prod-bucket"]
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    for_each = var.buckets
    bucket   = each.value
    }
    ```
- **`for`:** It is used inside expressions to generate lists or maps dynamically within a single resource, variable or output. It allows you to transform existing collections or create computed values without creating multiple resource instances. For example, you can use `for` to create a list of uppercase bucket names, but it does not create separate resources:
    ```
    variable "buckets" {
    type    = list(string)
    default = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
    }

    output "uppercase_buckets" {
    value = [for b in var.buckets : upper(b)]
    }
    ```
**Note:** `for_each` controls resource/module creation while `for` is used for data transformation within expressions.

---

**What happens if a resource fails halfway through a `terraform apply`?**
If a resource fails halfway through a `terraform apply`, Terraform leaves the successfully created resources running but marks the failed resource as tainted in the state file. This means that the next time you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will attempt to recreate only the failed or tainted resources, This leaves you in a partial state until all resources are successfully applied.

---

**What happens if terraform plan shows no changes but infrastructure was modified outside Terraform?**
If infrastructure was modified outside of Terraform, Terraform won’t automatically detect the drift during a regular `terraform plan` unless the state is refreshed. Running `terraform refresh` or `terraform plan -refresh-only` updates the state file to reflect the actual infrastructure that reveals any drift. Applying  future changes can lead to unexpected behavior such as overwriting manual changes or creating duplicate resources, until the drift is detected and reconciled.

---

**What’s the fastest way to rollback an Infra change in Terraform?**
The fastest way to roll back an infrastructure change in Terraform is to revert the Git commit containing the change and then run `terraform apply` to bring the infrastructure back to the previous state. For more granular control, you can use `terraform apply -target=resource.name` to roll back specific resources without affecting the entire environment. 

---

**What is the Terraform state file? How do you manage it securely in teams?**
The Terraform state file (.tfstate) stores the current state of your infrastructure as known to Terraform. It maps Terraform-managed resources to real-world cloud resources and it tracks metadata such as resource IDs, dependencies and attributes. Terraform uses the state file to determine what changes need to be made during a plan or apply operation by comparing with `.tf` files. If this file does not exist or tainted then Terraform wouldn’t know the difference between existing and new resources that will lead to potential recreation or drift issues.
It is always recommended to store state file in remote backend with locking mechanism to prevent from concurrent modifications (for example, AWS S3, Terraform Cloud or Azure Storage). Enable encyrption at rest and in transit, versioning and take regular backup of your state file. Additionally, restrict access permissions so only authorized CI/CD pipelines or team members can modify the state file.

---

**Difference between `terraform refresh`, `plan` and `apply`.**
- **`terraform refresh`:** It updates the Terraform state file to reflect the current state of your real infrastructure without making any actual changes to the resources. It queries the cloud provider APIs and synchronizes the local or remote state file with what exists in the environment. However, it does not modify your configuration or apply new changes. It simply aligns the state file with the actual infrastructure.
- **`terraform plan`:** It is used to preview what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure before actually applying them. It compares your current configuration files with the existing state file to determine what needs to be created, modified or destroyed. The plan output provides a detailed summary of all the proposed actions that allows you to review and validate changes before they are implemented.
- **`terraform apply`:** It takes the proposed changes from the plan and executes them to update your real infrastructure accordingly. It creates, updates or deletes resources to ensure that the deployed infrastructure matches your Terraform configuration. After successfully applying the changes, Terraform updates the state file to record the new resource information.

---

**How do you set up backend state in S3?**
When working in teams, it is crucial to setup a remote backend to store the Terraform state securely and centrally. In AWS, this is done using Amazon S3 for state storage and DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrent updates.
To set up an S3 backend, you first need an S3 bucket to store the Terraform state file and an optional DynamoDB table for state locking. The backend configuration is defined in a `backend.tf` file (or inside the main configuration). Below is an example:
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

---

**Difference between count and for_each.**
- **`count`:** This meta-argument is used to create multiple instances of the same resource based on a numeric value. Each instance is indexed numerically starting from 0 that you can reference using count.index and elements are not uniquely identifiable. However, one limitation of count is that if you remove an element from the list or change the order. It can cause Terraform to destroy and recreate resources due to index shifting.
    ```
    resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    count         = 3
    ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
    instance_type = "t3.micro"
    tags = {
        Name = "web-server-${count.index}"
    }
    }
    ```
    This configuration creates three EC2 instances named `web-server-0`, `web-server-1`, and `web-server-2`.
- **`for_each`:** This meta-argument is used to create multiple resource instances from a map or set of strings that allows each resource to be uniquely identified by a key. This makes updates safer and more predictable because Terraform tracks resources by their keys rather than index positions and avoids unnecessary destruction and recreation. `for_each` is ideal when working with dynamic or uniquely named resources.
    ```
    variable "instances" {
        type = map(string)
        default = {
            dev  = "t3.micro"
            prod = "t3.small"
        }
    }

    resource "aws_instance" "server" {
        for_each      = var.instances
        ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        instance_type = each.value
        tags = {
            Name = each.key
        }
    }
    ```
    This creates two EC2 instances, one named `dev` using `t3.micro` and another named `prod` using `t3.small`.

---

**Lifecycle block for all the rules with their use cases.**
The lifecycle block is used inside a resource to control how Terraform manages its create, update, and delete operations. It provides fine-grained control over how Terraform interacts with existing infrastructure. This helps in preventing accidental changes, preserve resources or handle special provisioning requirements.
- **`create_before_destroy`:** This rule ensures that a new resource is created before Terraform destroys the existing one when a change requires replacement. This minimizes downtime and is especially useful for production environments where availability is critical.
    ```
    resource "aws_instance" "web" {
        ami           = "ami-xxxxx"
        instance_type = "t3.micro"

        lifecycle {
            create_before_destroy = true
        }
    }
    ```
    This ensures the new EC2 instance is created before the old one is destroyed.
- **`prevent_destroy`:** This rule acts as a safety lock for critical resources that should never be deleted accidentally. If enabled, Terraform will block any operation that tries to destroy the resource that will protect important infrastructure like databases, production S3 buckets or IAM roles.
    ```
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "critical_data" {
        bucket = "prod-data-bucket"

        lifecycle {
            prevent_destroy = true
        }
    }
    ```
    Even if you run `terraform destroy`, Terraform will halt the process and prevent the S3 bucket from being deleted.
- **`ignore_changes`:** This rule tells Terraform to ignore specific resource attributes when they change outside Terraform. This prevents Terraform from detecting drift or trying to revert changes managed by other systems.
    ```
    resource "aws_instance" "app" {
        ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        instance_type = "t3.micro"
        tags = {
            Environment = "staging"
        }

        lifecycle {
            ignore_changes = [tags]
        }
    }
    ```
    If tags are updated manually in the AWS Console, Terraform won’t attempt to revert them on the next apply.
- **`replace_triggered_by`:** This rule ensures a resource is recreated whenever another resource or attribute changes. This is useful for tightly coupled components that must be updated together to maintain consistency.
    ```
    resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
        ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        instance_type = "t3.micro"

        lifecycle {
            replace_triggered_by = [aws_security_group.app_sg]
        }
    }
    ```
    If the security group `aws_security_group.app_sg` is replaced, Terraform will automatically replace the EC2 instance as well.
There are some rules supported by lifecycle block for `data`, `ephemeral` and `resource` blocks:
- **`precondition`:** This rule validates specific conditions before a resource is created or modified. It ensures that input variables or configurations meet expected requirements before Terraform proceeds. If the condition fails, Terraform stops and throws an error.
    ```
    resource "aws_instance" "server" {
        ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        instance_type = var.instance_type

        lifecycle {
            precondition {
            condition     = var.instance_type != "t2.micro"
            error_message = "t2.micro is not allowed for production environments."
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    Terraform will fail the plan if someone tries to deploy a t2.micro instance.
- **`postcondition`:** This rule validates the resource’s state after creation or modification. It ensures that the deployed resource meets the desired characteristics. This is useful for enforcing security or performance rules such as verifying a tag or ensuring encryption is enabled.
    ```
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure_bucket" {
        bucket = "my-secure-bucket"

        lifecycle {
            postcondition {
            condition     = self.bucket_prefix == null
            error_message = "Bucket prefix must not be set for this environment."
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    If the resulting S3 bucket configuration does not meet the condition, Terraform will fail after applying.
- **`destroy`:** This rule is only supported in `removed` block that defines whether to keep actual resource or not when resource configuration is removed from Terraform.
    ```
    removed {
        from = aws_instance.example

        lifecycle {
            destroy = false
        }
    }
    ```
    The `aws_instance.example` resource will be removed from the Terraform state but will remain intact in AWS.

---

**What happens during terraform init?**
When you run `terraform init`, Terraform initializes the working directory by setting up the backend, installing provider plugins and preparing modules. It checks the configuration files, downloads the required provider binaries from the registry or specified sources. It configures the remote backend based on the definition local or remote. Additionally, it validates module sources and ensures that any previously installed plugins are up-to-date. Essentially, `terraform init` prepares the environment so that subsequent commands like `plan` or `apply` can execute correctly.

---

**What are the best practices for organizing Terraform code and managing multiple environments?**
- **Use a modular structure:** Break your infrastructure into reusable modules that encapsulate specific resources or services (for example., VPC, S3, RDS).
- **Separate environments:** Maintain separate directory or workspace for each environment (dev, staging and production). Each environment should have its own variable values (terraform.tfvars) and backend configuration to avoid accidental cross-environment changes.
- **Use remote backends:** Store your Terraform state in a remote backend such S3, Terraform Cloud, or Azure Storage. Enable state locking and versioning to prevent concurrent changes and allow rollback if needed.
- **Define clear inputs and outputs:** Use variables for configurable parameters and outputs to expose important attributes. 
- **Version control and CI/CD:** Keep Terraform code in Git and implement CI/CD pipelines to automatically plan, run linting/validation and enforce approvals to apply changes.

---

**What is a taint in Terraform?**
A taint marks a resource for replacement during the next terraform apply. This is useful when a resource has become corrupted, misconfigured, or requires recreation for any reason. Running terraform apply after tainting will destroy the existing resource and create a new one. It ensures that the infrastructure is brought back to the desired state. 
**Note:** The `terraform taint` command is deprecated. Instead, use `-replace` flag with `terraform apply` command.
```
terraform taint aws_instance.web
terraform apply
or 
terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.web"
```
In this example, the aws_instance.web will replaced on the next apply. Terraform will destroy and recreate the EC2 instance automatically.

---

**How do you manage Terraform provider versioning?**
Terraform allows you to lock provider versions so that all team members and automation systems use the same version. This prevents unexpected behavior caused by automatic upgrades.
You can specify provider versions using the required_providers block in your configuration. This defines which providers are needed and their version constraints. It is recommended to use version constraints (=, ~>, or range operators) to prevent untested upgrades.
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = ">= 4.0, < 5.0"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
}
```

---

**What happens if someone manually changes infra outside of Terraform? How do you detect and fix it?**
If someone manually changes infrastructure outside of Terraform such as modifying a resource via the cloud console. Terraform’s state file becomes out of sync with the real infrastructure that leads to state drift. Terraform won’t automatically detect these changes until you run a command that refreshes the state. To detect such drift, you can run `terraform plan` or `terraform plan -refresh-only` that compares the actual infrastructure with the Terraform state and reports any differences. This helps identify resources that were changed, added, or deleted manually.
To fix drift, the best approach depends on the situation:
- If the manual change is intentional, update your Terraform configuration to match the new desired state and run `terraform apply` to reconcile it.
- If the change was unintentional, reapply the existing Terraform configuration with `terraform apply` to restore the infrastructure to its correct state.
- For manually created resources, use `terraform import` to bring them under Terraform management without recreating them.

---

**How do you implement dynamic blocks in Terraform?**
A dynamic block in Terraform allows you to generate nested configuration blocks dynamically based on variable data such as lists or maps. It’s useful when the number or structure of nested blocks (like SG rules, IAM policy) is not fixed and depends on input variables. Instead of duplicating similar code multiple times, you can use a `dynamic` block to loop through complex data structures and programmatically create multiple sub-blocks within a resource. Below is an example of AWS security group.
```
variable "ingress_rules" {
  type = list(object({
    from_port   = number
    to_port     = number
    protocol    = string
    cidr_blocks = list(string)
  }))
  default = [
    {
      from_port   = 22
      to_port     = 22
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    },
    {
      from_port   = 80
      to_port     = 80
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  ]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name        = "web-sg"
  description = "Security group with dynamic ingress rules"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-12345678"

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.ingress_rules
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value.from_port
      to_port     = ingress.value.to_port
      protocol    = ingress.value.protocol
      cidr_blocks = ingress.value.cidr_blocks
    }
  }
}
```
The `dynamic ingress` block loops over the list of `ingress_rules` and automatically creates multiple ingress blocks for each rule. The for_each expression controls iteration and the content block defines what each generated sub-block looks like.

---

**What to do when your Terraform state file becomes too large?**
When your Terraform state file becomes too large, it can slow down operations like `plan`, `apply`, and `refresh`. It can increase the risk of merge conflicts or locking issues in team environments. To address this issue, consider following:
- Split your Terraform configuration into smaller, logical modules (for example, network, compute, storage) so each has its own state file.
- Manage different environments (dev, stage, prod) in isolated workspaces or folders to reduce state size.
- Store your state in a remote backend like S3, GCS or Terraform Cloud for better performance, versioning, locking and team collaboration.
- Share outputs between projects using data "terraform_remote_state" instead of combining all resources into one configuration.

---

**What are the benefits of organizing a Terraform project using modules/workspaces?**
- **Modules promote reusability:** By breaking configurations into reusable modules (e.g., VPC, EC2, IAM), you can standardize deployments across multiple environments and teams without repeating the code.
- **Improved readability and collaboration:** Modular design keeps your Terraform files clean and organized, better for collaboration. Each module represents a specific component of your infrastructure with a well-defined interface (inputs and outputs).
- **Workspaces enable environment isolation:** Workspaces allow you to use the same configuration to manage multiple environments (such as dev, staging, and prod) with separate state files. This isolation ensures that changes in one environment don’t affect another that reduces deployment risks.
- **Simplified state management:** Since each workspace maintains its own state, managing updates, rollbacks, and environment-specific differences becomes much easier and safer.
- **Scalability and consistency:** Modules and workspaces allow teams to scale infrastructure efficiently while maintaining consistency across environments through standardized configurations and isolated states.

---

**How do you implement custom validation for input variables in Terraform?**
Custom validation can be implemented for input variables using the validation block inside a variable definition. This feature ensures that the values provided to variables meet specific conditions before Terraform proceeds with the plan or apply phase.
```
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type for the application"
  type        = string

  validation {
    condition     = contains(["t2.micro", "t3.micro", "t3.small"], var.instance_type)
    error_message = "Invalid instance type. Allowed values are t2.micro, t3.micro, or t3.small."
  }
}
```
Terraform checks whether the instance_type value is one of the allowed options. If a user provides a value outside the list, Terraform throws an error.

---

**How do you implement cross-account resource access and provisioning in Terraform?**
Implementing cross-account resource access and provisioning in Terraform involves configuring a separate provider with an authentication mechanism. This is implemented using AWS IAM roles and provider aliasing for different account access. This approach allows Terraform to manage resources across multiple accounts from a single configuration while maintaining least-privilege access and proper separation of duties.
```
# Default provider (management account)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Secondary provider (target account)
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "prod"
  region = "us-east-1"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CrossAccountTerraformRole"
  }
}

# Example resource in the target account
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "prod_bucket" {
  provider = aws.prod
  bucket   = "cross-account-prod-bucket"
  acl      = "private"
}
```
The default provider manages resources in the primary account. The aliased provider `aws.prod` assumes a role in a secondary account using `assume_role` that allows Terraform to create or modify resources in the secondary account.

---

**How would you provision infra across 10 AWS regions simultaneously?**
There are 2 ways to achieve this requirement:
- **providers:** Use provider aliases to provision infrastructure across multiple AWS regions simultaneously. Each provider alias represents a specific region, allowing you to deploy the same or different resources in multiple regions in parallel. For example:
    ```
    # Default provider for us-east-1
    provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
    }

    # Additional providers for other regions
    provider "aws" {
    alias  = "us-west-2"
    region = "us-west-2"
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "east_bucket" {
    bucket = "my-east-bucket"
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "west_bucket" {
    provider = aws.us-west-2
    bucket   = "my-west-bucket"
    }
    ```
- **region attribute:** Starting with AWS Provider v6, many resources now support a `region` argument at the resource level. This allows to create resources in multiple regions in same account using the same setups.
    ```
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "east_bucket" {
    bucket = "east-bucket"
    region = "us-east-1"
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "west_bucket" {
    bucket = "west-bucket"
    region = "us-west-2"
    }
    ```

**Terraform plan shows destroy + recreate for a critical DB — how to prevent downtime?**
- Firstly, review the `plan` thoroughly to indentify the attribute that triggered the resource replacement to verify whether this update is required and cannot be avoided.
- If this replacament is unavoidable then perform this change during maintenance window. Also, add the lifecycle rule `create_before_destroy` to create the resource first then destroy.
Following are some recommendations:
- For such critical resources, always define lifecycle rule `prevent_destroy` to prevent accidental.
- Also, enable delete protection at the resource level in your Terraform configuration.

**How do you implement effective dependency management between Terraform stacks?**
- **`terraform_remote_state`:** It allows one Terraform configuration to read outputs from another stack’s state file stored in a remote backend such as S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Terraform Cloud. For example, if your network stack provisions a VPC and subnets and your application stack needs those subnet IDs. You can expose them as outputs in the network stack:
    ```
    # network/outputs.tf
    output "private_subnet_id" {
        
    }
    ```
    Next, you can reference those outputs using a remote state data source in your appication stack:
    ```
    # app/main.tf
    data "terraform_remote_state" "network" {
        backend = "s3"
        config = {
            bucket = "my-tf-state"
            key    = "network/terraform.tfstate"
            region = "us-east-1"
        }
    }

    resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
        subnet_id = data.terraform_remote_state.network.outputs.private_subnet_id
    }
    ```
- **`depends_on`:** dependencies between resources are handled using the `depends_on` meta-argument in the same Terraform stack. This ensures Terraform understands the correct order in which to create, modify, or destroy resources. When the dependency isn’t automatically inferred through references.
    ```
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
        bucket = "my-log-bucket"
    }

    resource "aws_iam_role" "app_role" {
        name = "app-role"
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "log_policy" {
        bucket = aws_s3_bucket.logs.id
        policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.bucket_policy.json

        depends_on = [aws_iam_role.app_role]
    }
    ```
    The `depends_on` argument ensures Terraform creates the IAM role before applying the bucket policy.

**You need to import an existing AWS VPC into Terraform. What are the steps?**
- **Identify the existing resource:** Find the AWS VPC in the AWS console that you want to import and note down its VPC ID (for example, vpc-0abcd1234efgh5678).
- **Create a Terraform resource block:** Create the Terraform configuration for the AWS VPC resource. The configuration should match the existing VPC’s settings as closely as possible.
    ```
    resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
        cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
    }
    ```
- **Initialize Terraform:** If the terraform configuration is being used for the first time then run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory and download the aws provider plugins.
- **Import the resource into Terraform state:** Use the `terraform import` command to bring the existing VPC under Terraform’s management.
    `terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-0abcd1234efgh5678`
- **Review the imported state:** Run `terraform state show aws_vpc.main` to inspect the imported resource attributes and verify it matches your AWS environment.
- **Validate and plan:** Run `terraform plan` to verify Terraform doesn’t attempt to recreate or modify the imported resource.

**Explain terraform taint vs terraform state rm.**
- **`terraform taint`:** It is used to mark a specific resource for recreation during the next `terraform apply`. It does not delete the resource immediately; instead, it marks it as `tainted` in the state file. When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will first destroy the tainted resource and then recreate it to ensure a clean and correct state. This command is useful when a resource is in a corrupted or inconsistent state and needs to be rebuilt without affecting other infrastructure. For example, this marks the `web_server` resource for recreation during the next apply.
    `terraform taint aws_instance.web_server`
- **`terraform state rm`:** It is used to remove a resource from Terraform’s state file without destroying the actual infrastructure. This means the resource will continue to exist in the cloud provider, but Terraform will no longer track or manage it. This command is used when you want to decouple a resource from Terraform management. For example, this removes the `logs` bucket from Terraform state but leaves the bucket untouched in AWS.
    `terraform state rm aws_s3_bucket.logs`

---

**How do you manage Terraform state across workspaces.**
Workspaces allows you to maintain isolated environments (like dev, staging, prod) using the same Terraform configuration while keeping their states separate. Each workspace has its own state file which ensures that changes in one environment don’t accidentally affect another.
- **Create and switch workspaces:** Use Terraform commands to create a new workspace for each environment and switch between them:
    ```
    terraform workspace new dev
    terraform workspace new prod
    terraform workspace select dev
    ```
- **Use remote backends with workspaces:** Configure a remote backend that supports workspaces, like S3 with DynamoDB locking or Terraform Cloud. Terraform will maintain separate state files per workspace:
    ```
    terraform {
        backend "s3" {
            bucket         = "tf-state-bucket"
            key            = "app/${terraform.workspace}/terraform.tfstate"
            region         = "us-east-1"
            dynamodb_table = "tf-state-lock"
        }
    }
    ```
- **Maintain separate variables per workspace:** Use workspace-specific variable files or conditional expressions to manage environment differences without duplicating the configuration.
